# Rainfall_in_Australia

## Selected Topic 
Analysis of daily rainfall levels in each of Australia’s six states (New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia) from the years 2012-2017. Research results will be used to predict drought in 2018 for each of the six Australian states. 

## Explanation for Topic Selection 
Drought has always been a problem in Australia. Lack of rainfall has a negative impact on nature and the economy.  Extreme dryness can cause the following:

-	Starting of wildfires 
-	Disruption of animal habitats and ecosystems
-	Loss of crop production
-	Negative impact of soil quality, affecting future growing seasons
-	Livestock casualties from lack of food available
-	Water shortages

## Questions We Hope to Answer 
Will accurate long-term weather forecasting help Australians to prepare for drought? Some methods of drought preparation include water conservation, irrigation systems, crop diversification, and product sourcing. Providing advanced notice of approaching drought can help Australians prepare.
